- **1st offence** – the offender will be spoken to by the Team Manager or Head Coach where the offence will be explained. A plan will be agreed to prevent recurrence between the offender and the Coach/Manager. A note will be lodged with the Secretary and the offence will remain active during the period of the recovery plan.
- **2nd offence** – should this take place before the plan has timed out the offender will be given a second warning [sometimes referred to as a written warning] of the consequences of failing to meet the plan requirements. A shorter timescale 2nd plan will be agreed and signed off by the offender. This written plan will be logged by the Secretary.
- **3rd offence** – should the offender not meet the 2nd plan agreement then the Board shall meet (quorum 3) to decide on action. The action shall depend on the seriousness of the offence and may lead to suspension from training and or games or expulsion. The offender will be advised directly by a senior Committee Member and receive written notice of the offence, the decision and any additional disciplinary details signed by the Chair.

In extreme cases of major infringement, whether internal or external, the Board may take immediate action without following the 3 point disciplinary process where this is justified.
