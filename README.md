The club shall have the authority through its committee to render punishment on club members who fail to follow the rules and byelaws as laid out in this constitution.

Discipline punishments shall only be held if agreed by a quorum of committee members present during the offence or by special meeting of the committee for more severe disciplinary offences.

In addition the committee shall hold a disciplinary meeting against team members who receive major penalties before, during or after a game. Any player receiving such a penalty shall be awarded disciplinary action by the SIH Discipline Coordinator. The committee shall then decide if any further discipline is to be given to the individual based on the recorded evidential details or circumstances during the alleged offence. The game Bench Coach will be required to provide the committee with details of the offence.

Major or Minor offences / infringement of the rules within the Club will be dealt with by a disciplinary committee following a three point plan:

- **1st offence** – the offender will be spoken to by the Team Manager or Head Coach where the offence will be explained. A plan will be agreed to prevent recurrence between the offender and the Coach/Manager. A note will be lodged with the Secretary and the offence will remain active during the period of the recovery plan.
- **2nd offence** – should this take place before the plan has timed out the offender will be given a second warning [sometimes referred to as a written warning] of the consequences of failing to meet the plan requirements. A shorter timescale 2nd plan will be agreed and signed off by the offender. This written plan will be logged by the Secretary.
- **3rd offence** – should the offender not meet the 2nd plan agreement then the Disciplinary Committee shall meet to decide on action. The action shall depend on the seriousness of the offence and may lead to suspension from training and or games or even expulsion. The offender will be advised directly by a senior Committee Member and receive written notice of the offence, the decision and any additional disciplinary details signed by the Chairman.

In extreme cases on a major infringement, whether in house or external, the Disciplinary Committee may take action without following the 3 point disciplinary process where this is felt to be justified.
